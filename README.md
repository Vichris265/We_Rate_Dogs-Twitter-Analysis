# We_Rate_Dogs-Twitter-Analysis
An analysis of the Twitter dog rating as directed by Udacity project course.
This project involves my **data gathering** skills. I was able to gather the three needed datasets by downloading from web, querying the Twitter API and reading a provided csv file. 
Secondly, I performed **data assessment** where I pointed out the tidyness and quality issues in the three datasets.
Then, **data cleaning**. This is the most challenging part of the project.
I merged the three datasets and performed a simple exploratory analysis to check for further data issues that might be present in the dataset.
Finally, using power bi, I created a dashboard that shows some key insight in the dataset.
